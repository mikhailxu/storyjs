		Disclamer:
		This game is a clone of the first maze in
         <a href='http://www.ericsolomon.co.uk/sp/snakes.html'>http://www.ericsolomon.co.uk/sp/snakes.html</a>.
		I cloned it because the other game is too hard to play
		since the input is mouse heavy and the penalty 
		for every invalid click is a few seconds of my life.
		<p>Directions: use the arrow keys to move, or the spacebar to wait a round while the snakes move.  If you turn red, you're dead. You can hit (or hold) 'U' to undo a move or infinite, even if you're dead. You can't move over a snake.  See the other page (or the source <a href='snakepit.js'>code</a> and <a href='doc/'>documentation</a>) for complete rules and a few extra helpful features.  The goal is to get to the top right corner.
